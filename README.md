Docker is a platform designed to help developers build, share, and run modern applications. Docker handle all these tedious setup, so others can focus on the code. Docker makes the process of application deployment very easy and efficient and resolves a lot of issues related to deploying applications. Docker is the world's leading software container platform.

A typical software applications consist of a group of frontend components, backend components, databases, servers, libraries and other environment dependent components. And we have to ensure that, all these components work on a different and a wide range of platforms. 

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to deploy and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.
